# Introduction to Neural Networks

Neural networks are the foundation of many modern machine learning algorithms. This post will introduce the basic concepts of neural networks and their applications.

## What is a Neural Network?

A neural network is a computational model inspired by the human brain. It consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. The basic structure includes:

1. Input Layer: Receives the initial data
2. Hidden Layers: Process the data
3. Output Layer: Produces the final result

## Key Components

1. Neurons: The basic units that process information
2. Weights: Determine the strength of connections between neurons
3. Activation Functions: Introduce non-linearity into the network

## Applications

Neural networks are used in various fields, including:

- Image and Speech Recognition
- Natural Language Processing
- Game AI
- Autonomous Vehicles

In the next post, we'll dive into the training process of neural networks.
