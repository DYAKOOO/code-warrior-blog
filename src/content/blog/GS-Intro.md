# Introduction to Gaussian Splatting

Gaussian Splatting is a powerful technique in computer graphics that has gained significant attention in recent years. This post will introduce the fundamental concepts of Gaussian Splatting and its applications in 3D rendering.

## What is Gaussian Splatting?

Gaussian Splatting is a method used to render complex 3D scenes by representing surfaces as a collection of overlapping Gaussian functions. These Gaussians, or "splats," are projected onto the image plane to create a smooth, high-quality rendering.

## Key Advantages

1. Efficiency: Gaussian Splatting can render complex scenes faster than traditional polygon-based methods.
2. Quality: It produces smooth, anti-aliased results without the need for additional post-processing.
3. Flexibility: The technique is well-suited for rendering various types of geometry, including point clouds and particle systems.

In the next post, we'll dive deeper into the mathematics behind Gaussian Splatting.
