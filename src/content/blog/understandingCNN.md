# Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revolutionized the field of computer vision. This post will explain the architecture and key concepts of CNNs.

## CNN Architecture

A typical CNN consists of the following layers:

1. Convolutional Layers: Apply filters to detect features
2. Pooling Layers: Reduce spatial dimensions
3. Fully Connected Layers: Perform high-level reasoning

## Key Concepts

1. Convolution: The process of applying filters to input data
2. Feature Maps: Outputs of convolutional layers
3. Receptive Field: The region of the input that affects a particular CNN unit

## Applications of CNNs

CNNs are widely used in:

- Image Classification
- Object Detection
- Facial Recognition
- Medical Image Analysis

In the next post, we'll explore advanced CNN architectures and their specific use cases.
