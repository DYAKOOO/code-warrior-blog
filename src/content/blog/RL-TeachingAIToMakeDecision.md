# Reinforcement Learning: Teaching AI to Make Decisions

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful paradigm in machine learning that focuses on teaching AI agents to make decisions through interaction with an environment. This post will introduce the key concepts of RL.

## Core Components of RL

1. Agent: The learner or decision-maker
2. Environment: The world in which the agent operates
3. State: The current situation of the agent
4. Action: What the agent can do
5. Reward: Feedback from the environment

## Key Algorithms

1. Q-Learning: A value-based method for learning optimal action-selection policy
2. Policy Gradient: Directly learn the policy without using a value function
3. Actor-Critic: Combine value-based and policy-based methods

## Applications of RL

Reinforcement Learning is used in various domains:

- Game AI (e.g., AlphaGo)
- Robotics
- Autonomous Vehicles
- Resource Management

In future posts, we'll dive deeper into specific RL algorithms and their implementations.
