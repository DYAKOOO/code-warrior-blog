# Implementing Gaussian Splatting in Real-Time Rendering 

This post will focus on practical strategies for implementing Gaussian Splatting in real-time rendering systems.

## GPU-Accelerated Splatting

To achieve real-time performance, Gaussian Splatting is typically implemented on GPUs. The process involves:

1. Storing Gaussian parameters (position, orientation, size) in GPU memory
2. Using geometry shaders to generate screen-space ellipses for each Gaussian
3. Rasterizing these ellipses and accumulating their contributions in a fragment shader

## Optimization Techniques

Several optimization techniques can be employed:

1. Level-of-Detail (LOD): Adjust the number and size of Gaussians based on distance from the camera
2. Culling: Efficiently discard Gaussians that are not visible
3. Deferred Splatting: Separate the generation of Gaussians from their shading for improved performance

In future posts, we'll explore advanced topics in Gaussian Splatting, including its applications in neural rendering.
